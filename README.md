# Project Todo âœ…

The aim of the project was to build a TODO app using React, Redux, JSX and styled components. In this app the user should be able to add/remove tasks, list tasks and toggle when a task is completed or not.

# The challenge?

The challenge was to graps how Redux interacts with React to dispatch actions and how information is sent and received between the store and the different components. To overcome this I challenged myself to create more component in order to get more comfortable with the flow and structure of redux.

It was a fun and creative project to learn redux. If I had more time I would like to make a conditional rendering that would change the background image depending on the time of the day.
